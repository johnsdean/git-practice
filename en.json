    "FAQ-GENERAL-QUESTION_1":"1. What is SmartResponse?",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_1_1":"- SmartResponse is an online platform that collects and analyzes location specific, pre- and post-disaster data from local, state and national organizations providing humanitarian assistance.",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_1_2":"- SmartResponse is the first independent, data-driven resource to display location-specific information from these organizations including: budget, legal/registration status, types of services provided by sector, number of staff on the ground, history of involvement in a particular location, partners and organizational affiliations, start and end dates of relief efforts, and total funds raised and spent on that particular response.",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-INFO_1":"You can donate via our website at ",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-INFO_2":"Tell others you know about this valuable information resource.",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-QUESTION_2":"2. How to start using the website",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-QUESTION_3":"3. How to make sure that data published by organizations is correct?",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_3_1":"- Data in SmartResponse is self-reported. Let’s work together to keep it accurate.",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_3_2":"- Use the red-flag reporting tool to report any data you believe to be untrue. You must offer a justification for your flag and reports will be reviewed by DAP staff. In addition, DAP is:",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_3_3":"- Recruiting local volunteers to assist with reviewing data",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_3_4":"- Engaging local media, civil society, and charity watchdogs",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_3_5":"- Penalizing organizations that require staff moderation of survey responses due to site policy violations, such as sharing inaccurate information",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-QUESTION_4":"4. How to support an organization?",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_4_1":"Organizations can be support on their “General Organization” page, Location-specific pages, and Disaster-specific pages.",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_4_2":"- Any donations made from a “General Organization” page will be accompanied by a note specifying that the donation is intended to serve as a general operating donation",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_4_3":"- Any donations made from a “Location-specific” page will be accompanied by a note specifying that the donation is intended to support organization activities in that specific location",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_4_4":"- Any donations made from a “Disaster-specific” page will be accompanied by a note specifying that the donation is intended to support organization activities specific to that particular disaster",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-QUESTION_5":"5. How to make sure that data is up to date?",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_5_1":"There is a real benefit to organizations for keeping their data up to date. As an independent watchdog, organizations cannot pay DAP for placement on the site. Current data is a key factor in the placement of organizations on the Location and Disaster pages.",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_5_2":"Make sure to check the last update date next to data in the site. If you see the words: “Outdated” or “Refused” next to a time-stamp, that organization’s data is not current.",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-QUESTION_6":"6. How to choose an organization?",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_6_1":"Everyone has a different reason for making a donation. The information provided on the SmartResponse is just the tip of the iceberg.",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_6_2":"The fact an organization places first on any list does not mean they are “better” than organizations that place lower.",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_6_3":"Consider what is needed and also what is important to you. Have a question? Ask us.",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-QUESTION_7":"7. How is data collected?",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_7_1":"Data is collected via survey. Some organizations are invited to share their data, others self-register. The data on SmartResponse is self-reported.",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-QUESTION_8":"8. What does “red-flagging” data mean?",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_8_1":"We allow users to “red-flag” individual survey that is suspected false or untrue.",
    "FAQ-GENERAL-ANSWER_8_2":"Any “red-flag” report must be accompanied by a justification. All reports will be reviewed by site moderators and/or administrators.",
